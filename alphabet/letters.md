# Latin Alphabet

The Latin alphabet used for Tatar spoken in Romania, as described in Taner Murat's work (based on the system used at the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures, University of Bucharest), consists of **32 graphemes**. This includes 10 letters for determinant sounds (vowels) and 22 for determined sounds (consonants and semivowels).

This differs slightly from the **33 letters** proposed in the 1956 standardization discussions (see [History](../history/alphabet_standardization.md)), which included the letter `Ţ ţ`.

The alphabet is presented below, noting key distinctions, particularly between "authentic" and "academic" usage as described by Murat.

| # | Latin Character | Name       | Notes                                                                 |
|---|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | A a             | A          | Low unrounded **RTR (hard) vowel**.                                   |
| 2 | Á á             | Hemzelí A  | Near-low unrounded **ATR (soft) vowel**. Occurs only in Arabic/Persian loanwords (academic). Not authentic. |
| 3 | B b             | Be         | **Hard** and *soft* voiced bilabial stop /b/.                           |
| 4 | Ç ç             | Çe         | **Hard** and *soft* voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /t͡ʃ/. Quasi non-existent in authentic Dobruja Tatar, often shifting to (Ş). Treated as academic. |
| 5 | D d             | De         | **Hard** and *soft* voiced dental stop /d/.                             |

| 20| O o             | O          | Mid rounded **RTR (hard) vowel** /o/.                                 |

*Note:* Described by Murat, certain letters/sounds (`B`, `D`, `G`, `Ğ`, `I`, `Ó`, `U`, `Ú`, `V`) typically do not occur as the final letter of a word (with some exceptions like `ald`, `dad`).

The "hard" and "soft" variations of consonants are determined by the preceding vowel's tongue root position due to vowel harmony (see [Phonology: Harmony](../phonology/harmony.md)). In this documentation, **bold** is used for hard sounds/contexts and *italics* for soft sounds/contexts, following the distinction made in the source material.
