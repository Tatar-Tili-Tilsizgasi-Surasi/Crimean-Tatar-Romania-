--- Summary of Key Differences: Standard Crimean Tatar (SCT) vs. Dobrujan Tatar (DT - Romania) ---
This summary encapsulates major differences based on linguistic analysis and comparative examples.
I. Phonology & Orthography:
Vowel System & Reductions (Major Differences):
SCT ı (undotted i) -> DT î (Kalpaklî I /ɯ/): Very consistent. Ex: SCT: qızıl -> DT: kîzîl
SCT i (dotted i) -> DT í (Kîska I /ɪ/ or similar reduced vowel): Extremely common reduction, especially in suffixes, unstressed syllables, and even some roots/pronouns. Some full 'i' sounds (represented by the letter 'I i') might remain in specific contexts, notably in many loanwords from non-Arabic/Persian sources. Ex: SCT: keldim -> DT: keldím; SCT: kim -> DT: kím; SCT: iş -> DT: íş; SCT: ketir- -> DT: ketír-
SCT ü -> DT ú (Noktalî U /ʉ/ or similar high front/central rounded): This is the most common transformation for SCT ü. Ex: SCT: kün -> DT: kún; SCT: bütün -> DT: bútún; SCT: gül -> DT: gúl
SCT ü -> DT í (Specific Cases): Some specific words or morphemes show a more drastic unrounding and fronting/centralizing of ü to í. Ex: SCT: köpür -> DT: kópír; SCT suffix -düm -> DT suffix -dím (as in kórdím)
SCT ö -> DT ó (Noktalî O /œ/ or similar mid front/central rounded): Consistent. Ex: SCT: köz -> DT: kóz; SCT: körmek -> DT: kórmek
SCT u -> DT î (Specific Cases): Some SCT u sounds, especially in roots or specific contexts, can reduce significantly to î. Ex: SCT: armut -> DT: armît; SCT: oturıp -> DT: otîrîp; SCT: oqumaq -> DT: okîmak; SCT: duygu -> DT: duygî (final -u)
SCT e -> DT e / á (Hemzelí A /æ/): 'e' is common. 'á' is for specific loanwords requiring /æ/.
Word-Final Vowels: DT often avoids certain plain final vowels that SCT might have. Reduced vowels í, î at word ends are common.
Consonant Shifts (Significant & Common):
SCT C c (representing /dʒ/ sound) -> DT Ğ ğ: The letter 'C c' from SCT, which typically represents the /dʒ/ sound (like 'j' in English 'gem'), corresponds to the letter 'Ğ ğ' in DT. The DT letter 'Ğ ğ' consistently represents this /dʒ/ sound. Ex: SCT: ocaq -> DT: oğak. (Note: some specific lexical items might show SCT C > DT Ş, e.g. SCT: yolcı -> DT: ğolşî, this reflects a sound change of /dʒ/ to /ʃ/ in those specific words). THIS IS A CRITICAL AND MANDATORY CHANGE.
SCT Ğ ğ (representing /ɣ/ or /ʁ/ sounds) -> DT G g: The letter 'Ğ ğ' from SCT, which typically represents velar/uvular fricative sounds (/ɣ/, /ʁ/), corresponds to the letter 'G g' in DT. The DT letter 'G g' has various pronunciations depending on vowel harmony, including a uvular variant similar to Arabic 'ghayn' when with back vowels (see DT Alphabet Guide for G g). Ex: SCT: ağa -> DT: aga (master/elder brother).
Initial SCT Y- -> DT Ğ- (/dʒ/): A very strong and frequent pattern. Ex: SCT: yaz -> DT: ğaz; SCT: yeñi -> DT: ğañî; SCT: yol -> DT: ğol; SCT: yolcı -> DT: ğolşî
SCT Ç (/tʃ/) -> DT Ş (/ʃ/): Very common, "authentic" shift. Use Ş by default. Ex: SCT: içün -> DT: úşún; SCT: çay -> DT: şay; SCT: qaçmaq -> DT: kaşmak
SCT Q -> DT K (representing /q/): Consistent. Ex: SCT: qara -> DT: kara; SCT: oqumaq -> DT: okîmak
SCT F -> DT P (Authentic): Common for naturalized words. F for academic loans. Ex: SCT: fayda -> DT: payda
SCT V -> DT W (Authentic) or B: Common for naturalized words. V for academic loans. Ex: SCT: vatan -> DT: watan; SCT: suv -> DT: suw
Initial SCT D- -> DT T- (Specific Lexical Items - Devoicing): Ex: SCT: düşünce -> DT: túşúnğe.
Prothetic w- before initial u- (Specific Verbs): Ex: SCT: urmaq -> DT: wurmaq
Orthography:
Interrogative Particle mı/mi/mu/mú/mî/mí: Written as a separate word in DT. Ex: SCT: keleceksizmi? -> DT: keleğeksíz mí?
II. Lexicon (Significant Divergence):
DT often prefers different (though usually related Turkic) lexical items for common words compared to SCT. This requires a lexical substitution list. PRIORITIZE DT LEXICAL ITEMS FROM EXAMPLES AND DICTIONARY.
Replacement of Loanwords: Russian and Ukrainian loanwords common in Standard Crimean Tatar should generally be replaced with appropriate Romanian, Turkish, or natively derived (often Arabic/Persian based) alternatives in Dobrujan Tatar.
SCT: kənd (village) -> DT: kóy
SCT: qayıtmaq (to return) -> DT: kelmek (to come/arrive, implying return)
SCT: çoq (much, very) -> DT: kóp
SCT: büyük (big) -> DT: balaban
SCT: ev (house) -> DT: úy
SCT: tarih (history) -> DT: tewúke (story, tale, history)
SCT: üzerinde(n) (on, over) -> DT: ústínde(n)
SCT: avtomobil (car) -> DT: araba
SCT: yanında (next to) -> DT: katînda
SCT: göl (lake) -> DT: kól
SCT: armut (pear) -> DT: armît
SCT: yemek (food - as option) -> DT: ğemek
SCT: yatmaq (to lie/sleep - for animals) -> DT: ğatmaq
III. Grammar & Morphology:
Comitative (Postposition "with"):
DT uses the invariant postposition "men" after the noun/pronoun.
SCT: menimle (with me) -> DT: men men
SCT: seninle (with you sg.) -> DT: sen men
SCT: biznen (with us) -> DT: bíz men
Future Tense:
SCT -AcAK/-EcEK. DT seems to use -AğaK/-eğeK (intervocalic k->ğ).
For vowel-stem verbs: -Ayağak / -eyeğek. Ex: SCT: başlacek -> DT: başlayağak
Periphrastic Future: Common with Participle (-A(y)ağak) + bolmaq (conjugated). Ex: DT: başlayağak bolamîz (we will start)
1st Person Singular Present/Future Suffix:
DT uses -AmAn / -emen. Ex: SCT: ketem -> DT: ketemen
Attached to future stem: keteğek + men -> keteğekmen.
1st Person Plural Suffix (e.g., with bolmaq):
DT uses -Amîz / -emîz (with vowel reduction). Ex: DT: bolamîz
Definite Accusative Case:
SCT uses -nI. DT also uses -nI (e.g., yemekní, itní).
DT also shows evidence of -tI / -dI after certain stems (especially those ending in voiceless consonants or specific nouns). This is a significant Kipchak feature. Ex: DT: ğemektí (food-ACC); ittí (dog-ACC)
Possessive Suffixes: Show internal vowel harmony and reduction.
SCT: üyümizniñ -> DT: úyímízníñ
Assimilation/Simplification:
SCT: Balalar -> DT: Ballar (Example of potential assimilation/simplification, needs more examples to confirm universality)
IV. General Tendencies:
Strong Vowel Reduction: Especially i->í, ı->î, and ü->ú are pervasive. Specific ü->í and u->î reductions in certain roots and suffixes are also key.
Preference for Kipchak-type features: The -tI/-dI accusative, the comitative with "men", some lexical choices, and potentially some phonetic shifts point towards a stronger Kipchak influence or preservation of older Kipchak features compared to SCT (which has Oguz influences).
Naturalization of Loans: Strong tendency to adapt loans phonetically (F->P, V->W) and sometimes replace them with established Turkic/regional words.
