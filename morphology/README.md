This section is currently a placeholder for documenting the morphology (word formation) of Crimean Tatar spoken in Romania.

Content to be added:
*   Agglutination (Tírkeleşúw) principles and examples (linking back to vowel harmony)
*   Suffix types (tonic, atonic, posttonic, overtonic, generative) and their effect on stress (Section 5.6)
*   Derivational processes
*   Inflectional processes
*   ...and more.
