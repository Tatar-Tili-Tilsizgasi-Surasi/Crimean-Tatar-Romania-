# Vowel Harmony (Awaz tertíbí, Karşî turgan deñge, Eğík íşí ses uyîmî, Eğík tíşí ses uyîmî)

Vowel harmony is a fundamental principle in Crimean Tatar spoken in Romania, influencing the quality of both vowels and consonants. It is described through several principles:

1.  **Harmonic Hierarchy Principle (Awaz tertíbí):** Speech sounds are ranked in harmonic scales.
2.  **Harmonic Parallelism Principle (Karşî turgan deñge):** Any speech sound has a balancing, similar, opposite, and complementary sound peer. This is evident in the hard/soft pairs.
3.  **Articulatory Determinism Principle (Belgílí buwunlî irtibat):** The pronunciation of a sound is linked to its neighbors.
4.  **Musicality Principle (Ses zewukî):** Phonetic combinations are consonant, esthetic, and euphonic when sounds are in harmony with contextual pitch, tone, and harmony.
5.  **Least Effort Principle (Eñ az zahmetlí telaffuz):** Sound sequences are easier to pronounce with minimal movement of the tongue root, lips, and jaws. This principle underlies vowel reduction and delabialization.

The primary mechanism of harmony is **Tongue Root Position**, dividing sounds into two main groups:

*   **Retracted Tongue Root (RTR) / Hard Sounds:** Associated with RTR vowels (`A`, `Î`, `O`, `U`) and accompanying consonants/semivowels (the "hard" variants).
*   **Advanced Tongue Root (ATR) / Soft Sounds:** Associated with ATR vowels (`Á`, `E`, `I`, `Í`, `Ó`, `Ú`) and accompanying consonants/semivowels (the "soft" variants).

The "hard" and "soft" qualities apply to consonants as well, meaning a consonant's pronunciation slightly changes depending on whether it is in a syllable with a hard or soft vowel (see [Phonetics](../phonetics/sounds.md)).

This leads to two main laws of harmony:

1.  **Law of Intrasyllabic Harmony (Eğík íşí ses uyîmî):** All determinant (vowel) and determined (consonant/semivowel) sounds *within a single syllable* must belong to the same tongue root group. A syllable is either entirely hard or entirely soft.
2.  **Law of Intersyllabic Harmony (Eğík tíşí ses uyîmî / The Golden Nature):** In agglutination, subsequent syllables must harmonize with the determinant sound (vowel) of the preceding syllable in terms of tongue root position. Authentic words are typically entirely hard or entirely soft. This is called the "Golden" or "Altaic" syllable (`altan` or `altay`).

This strict harmony system, driven by the least effort principle, simplifies articulation by minimizing large tongue root movements within words.
