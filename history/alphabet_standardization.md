# History of Alphabet Standardization

The Latin alphabet for Crimean Tatar spoken in Romania was developed through a standardization process involving linguists and Tatar representatives, aiming to create a system suitable for education and publication within Romania.

## Context

Prior to standardization efforts in Romania, Tatar communities in Dobruja used different writing practices or relied on Turkish-language schools. Manuals imported from the Tatar ASSR (Kazan Tatar) were found unsuitable due to significant differences from the Crimean Tatar dialect spoken in Dobruja. Recognizing the need for a local standard, particularly for educational materials, a commission was formed.

## The 1954-1956 Discussions

A commission was established in 1954, including representatives from the Ministry of Education and the Academy of the Romanian People's Republic, to study the situation. Based on their findings, it was decided to create new teaching materials in the local Tatar language. This necessitated developing a standardized alphabet and orthography.

Discussions involved linguists like Vladimir Drîmba (Institute of Linguistics), pedagogues, and Tatar intellectuals (Ziyaeddin Ismail, Ali Ahmet Naği, Ekrem Mehmet Ali, and others). The goal was to base the alphabet on the Latin script, specifically incorporating elements from both the modern Turkish and Romanian alphabets, augmented with special diacritics for sounds unique to Tatar.

The proposed alphabet aimed to facilitate learning Romanian while providing a written standard for Tatar, aligning with the socialist cultural policies of the time, similar to how other languages in the Soviet Union adopted Cyrillic alphabets based on Russian.

Key debates included:

*   **Special Vowels:** Proposing dedicated letters for specific Tatar vowels (`Í í`, `Î î`, `Ó ó`, `Ú ú`). Debates occurred over the specific diacritics (e.g., accent vs. breve).
*   **Ç and Ğ:** Discussed representation for palato-alveolar affricates. Options included `Č č` and `Ğ ğ` or using `c` and `g` as in Romanian `ci`/`gi` spellings (proposed by A. Graur).
*   **G and K variations:** How to represent the velar, palatal, and uvular variants (`g`/`k` vs. `q`/`ʁ`). Proposals included special spellings like `gâ`, `kâ`, `lâ` (using circumflex over the vowel) or using different consonant combinations (`gy`/`ky`/`ly`) or diacritics (`g'`, `k'`, `l'`).
*   **Ñ:** Representation for the nasal sounds. Proposals included `ñ`, `η`, or `ng`.
*   **V and W:** Debated whether to use separate letters (`v`, `w`) or represent semivowels with `u` and `i` as in Romanian.
*   **Ţ ţ:** The historical documents mention a letter `Ţ ţ` (ţe) representing the sound [ts], which was treated as academic and naturalized to `S s`. This letter is not present in the alphabet described in Taner Murat's later work, suggesting it was fully naturalized.

## The Proposed 1956 Alphabet (33 Letters)

Following the discussions, a definitive proposed alphabet of **33 letters** was established (as shown in the scanned document, page 8). It included 10 vowels and 23 consonants/semivowels.

| Character | Name  | Character | Name  | Character | Name  |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| A a       | a     | Î î       | î     | P p       | pe    |
| Á á       | á     | I i       | ie    | R r       | re    |
| B b       | be    | J j       | je    | S s       | se    |
| Č č       | če    | K k       | ke    | Ș ș       | şe    |
| D d       | de    | L l       | le    | T t       | te    |
| E e       | e     | M m       | me    | Ț ț       | țe    |
| F f       | fe    | N n       | ne    | U u       | u     |
| G g       | ge    | Ñ ñ       | eñ    | Ú ú       | ú     |
| Ǧ ǧ       | ǧe    | O o       | o     | V v       | ve    |
| H h       | he    | Ó ó       | ó     | W w       | we    |
| Í í       | í     |           |       | Y y       | ye    |
|           |       |           |       | Z z       | ze    |

*Note:* The document lists `Č č` and `Ǧ ǧ` here, contrasting with `Ç ç` and `Ğ ğ` in Murat's 2018 table, and includes `Ț ț` which is not in Murat's table. Also `Ș ș` has been evolved to `Ş ş` (for `Ț ț` it would be `Ţ ţ`). The system described by Murat in 2018 appears to be an evolution or specific implementation (likely the 1985 one mentioned) of these earlier efforts, resulting in the 32-letter alphabet he presents.

This standardization effort provided a basis for literacy and education in Crimean Tatar in Romania, although the usage and status of certain sounds (like Ç, F, H, V, and historically Ţ) vary between authentic everyday speech and academic contexts.
